# Placeholder file to ensure the templates directory is tracked by version control.

The `cards` subdirectory should contain reference images for each playing card,
named using standard two‑character codes (e.g. `As.png` for Ace of spades,
`Td.png` for Ten of diamonds).  These images are used for template
matching in the card recognition logic.  You will need to extract
individual card images from your poker client and save them here to
enable card recognition.
