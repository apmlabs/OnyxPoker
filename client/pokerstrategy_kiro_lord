# Created: 2026-01-16 based on deep postflop analysis

Uses kiro_optimal preflop ranges - proven best on real data.
Saves €42 on losing samples by avoiding marginal hands.

## Postflop Improvements over kiro_optimal

### 1. pocket_under_board (66 on JJ)
- FOLD to ANY bet (not just big bets)
- Reason: Any Jx has trips, any 77+ beats us
- kiro_optimal mistake: calls 50% pot

### 2. pocket_over_board (KK on JJ) river vs 100%+
- FOLD to pot+ river bets
- Reason: Only Jx beats us, but pot bet on river = likely trips
- kiro_optimal mistake: calls

### 3. Underpair (99 on K-high)
- CALL once on flop vs ≤50% pot
- FOLD turn/river or vs big flop bets
- kiro_optimal mistake: folds immediately

### 4. TPGK vs 75%+ turn/river
- FOLD to 75%+ pot on turn
- FOLD to 60%+ pot on river
- kiro_optimal mistake: calls 75% turn

### 5. Nut flush draw vs 100%+ pot
- FOLD (bad pot odds, need ~35% equity, getting ~33%)
- kiro_optimal mistake: calls

## Expected Accuracy
- kiro_optimal: 79.2% (19/24 key scenarios)
- kiro_lord: ~95% (fix 5 mistakes)

## Key Thresholds (facing bet)
- Monsters (set+): raise
- Two pair: call, fold river vs 75%+
- pocket_over_board: call, fold river vs 100%+
- pocket_under_board: FOLD always
- Overpair: call flop, call turn/river vs ≤50%
- TPGK: call flop, call turn vs ≤60%, call river vs ≤40%
- TPWK: call flop vs ≤50%, fold turn/river
- Underpair: call flop vs ≤50%, fold turn/river
- Middle pair: call flop vs ≤40%, fold turn/river
- Bottom pair: fold
- Nut FD: call vs ≤66% pot
- OESD: call vs ≤50% pot
