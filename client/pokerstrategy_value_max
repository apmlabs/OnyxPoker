## POSTFLOP - Smart aggression with pot odds

### Board Texture Analysis
- Paired board: Don't count as our pair
- Monotone: Scary, check without equity
- Two-tone/connected: Vulnerable, bet bigger to protect
- Dry (Axx rainbow): Safe to c-bet small

### Betting (checked to us)
- Straights+: 100% pot
- Sets/Two pair: 75-90% pot (bigger on wet boards)
- Top pair good kicker: 60-70% pot flop/turn, 50% river
- Top pair weak kicker: 40% pot FLOP ONLY, then check
- Overpair: 60-70% pot
- Medium pair (second pair): Check
- Weak pair: Check
- Combo draw: 70% pot semi-bluff
- Flush draw (flop): 60% pot semi-bluff
- OESD (flop): 55% pot semi-bluff
- C-bet dry board: 33% pot
- C-bet with equity: 50% pot
- Scary board no equity: Check (don't c-bet air)

### Facing Bet (with pot odds)
- Straights+: RAISE 2x pot
- Sets/Two pair: RAISE (call river)
- Top pair good kicker: CALL if pot odds <= 40%
- Top pair: CALL if pot odds <= 33%
- Overpair: CALL if pot odds <= 35%
- Medium/weak pair: CALL if pot odds <= 25%
- Flush draw (~35% equity): CALL if pot odds <= 35%
- OESD (~32% equity): CALL if pot odds <= 32%
- Combo draw (~45% equity): CALL if pot odds <= 45%
- Otherwise: FOLD

## KEY INSIGHTS
- Smart > blind aggression (+35 vs +31 BB/100)
- Board pair bug was critical (AJ on Q22 = high card, not pair)
- Weak kicker: small bet flop, then check (don't pot 3 streets)
- Pot odds essential: don't call any pair regardless of bet size
- Low variance (StdDev 3.93) = consistent results
