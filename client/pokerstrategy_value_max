POSTFLOP - BIG BETS FOR VALUE

Key principle: 2NL players call too much. Bigger bets = more value.

VALUE HANDS (bet 85-100% pot):
- Straights+: 100% pot all streets
- Sets/two pair: 90% pot all streets
- Top pair: 85%/80%/75% (flop/turn/river)
- Overpair: 85% pot all streets

DRAWS (semi-bluff big):
- Combo draws: 80% pot
- Flush draw (flop): 70% pot
- OESD (flop): 65% pot

C-BETTING:
- As aggressor on flop: 60% pot
- Otherwise: check

FACING BETS:
- Straights+: Raise for value
- Sets/two pair: Raise (call river)
- Top pair good kicker: Call
- Top pair weak kicker: Call flop only
- Draws: Call if getting 2:1 or better

WHY THIS WORKS

1. Fish call too much -> bigger bets extract more value
2. TAGs/NITs fold to big bets -> win pots uncontested
3. Same hand, same opponent:
   - 50% pot bets: win 30BB
   - 100% pot bets: win 70BB
   - 2.3x more profit!
