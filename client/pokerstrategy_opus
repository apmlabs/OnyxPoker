PREFLOP STRATEGY:

CRITICAL: CHECK SUITS FIRST! Same suit = suited (s). Different suits = offsuit (o).
Example: Kh7h = K7s (CALL). Kh7c = K7o (FOLD).

RAISE 2.5x: AA-99, AKs-ATs, AKo, AQo, AJo, KQs, KJs, QJs
AJo RULE: AJo vs single open = 3-BET always.

CALL vs open (€0.05 or less) - SUITED ONLY:
- ALL pairs: 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88 = CALL
- ALL suited aces: A2s, A3s, A4s, A5s, A6s, A7s, A8s, A9s = CALL
- ALL suited kings: K2s, K3s, K4s, K5s, K6s, K7s, K8s, K9s = CALL
- ALL suited queens: Q2s, Q3s, Q4s, Q5s, Q6s, Q7s, Q8s, Q9s = CALL
- ALL suited connectors: 32s, 43s, 54s, 65s, 76s, 87s, 98s, T9s, JTs = CALL
- ALL suited one-gappers: 42s, 53s, 64s, 75s, 86s, 97s, T8s, J9s = CALL
IMPORTANT: K6s = CALL, K5s = CALL, K4s = CALL (all suited kings call!)

VS 3-BET (€0.15+): Call JJ-99, AQs, AKo. 4-bet QQ+, AKs. Fold rest.

FOLD ALWAYS - OFFSUIT (different suits):
- A9o, A8o, A7o, A6o, A5o, A4o, A3o, A2o = FOLD
- KJo, KTo, K9o, K8o, K7o, K6o, K5o = FOLD
- QJo, QTo, Q9o = FOLD
- JTo, J9o = FOLD
- T9o, 98o, 87o, 76o, 65o, 54o = FOLD
- Any hand with DIFFERENT SUITS not listed above = FOLD

BOTTOM PAIR: CHECK always. Never bet with bottom pair.

POSTFLOP STRATEGY:
- STRAIGHTS/FLUSHES/SETS/FULL HOUSE: BET 75-100% pot
- TWO PAIR (both hole cards paired): BET 75% pot all streets
- BOARD PAIR + POCKET PAIR (44 on K33): BET flop 70%, CHECK turn
- COMBO DRAWS (flush+straight, flush+pair): SEMI-BLUFF 65-75% pot
- TOP PAIR GOOD KICKER (AK/AQ/AJ on Axx): BET 70% flop, 65% turn, 50% river
- TOP PAIR WEAK KICKER (K7 on Kxx): BET flop 70% ONLY. If bet at later, CALL. Never RAISE.
- OVERPAIR on scary board (KK on Axx): CHECK-CALL only. NEVER raise.
- FLUSH DRAW alone: Check if free, call up to 40% pot
- STRAIGHT DRAW alone: Check if free, call up to 33% pot
- NO PAIR NO DRAW: CHECK always. NEVER bet with just ace-high or king-high.
