2NL BLITZ EXPLOIT STRATEGY - MAXIMUM VALUE EXTRACTION

CORE PHILOSOPHY
- 2NL players call too much → bet bigger for value
- 2NL players 3-bet only value → respect 3-bets but defend IP
- 2NL players don't bluff rivers → never hero call
- 2NL players fold blinds too much → steal relentlessly

SUIT CHECK: Same suit = suited (s). Different = offsuit (o).

===================
KEY EXPLOITS
===================

1. STEAL BLINDS RELENTLESSLY
   - Open 52% from BTN (they fold 65-75%)
   - Every fold = +0.035bb profit

2. VALUE BET BIGGER
   - They call with any pair
   - Bet 75-85% pot with strong hands
   - Don't slowplay (they won't bet for you)

3. RESPECT 3-BETS BUT DEFEND IP
   - 3-bets are 90% value at 2NL
   - But call with 88-99, AQo, AJs IP (set mine + dominate)
   - Fold marginal hands OOP

4. FOLD TO TURN/RIVER AGGRESSION
   - Turn raises = 95% value
   - River raises = 98% value
   - Don't hero call with one pair

5. DON'T BLUFF RIVERS
   - They don't fold
   - Save chips for value betting

===================
WIN RATE FORMULA
===================

Your profit comes from:
45% - Stealing blinds (open wider, defend less)
35% - Value betting big (they call light)
15% - Folding to aggression (they have it)
5%  - Not bluffing rivers (they call)

Expected win rate: +8-12 BB/100 at 2NL
