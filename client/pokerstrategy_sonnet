BLITZ 6-MAX OPTIMAL EXPLOITATIVE STRATEGY (2NL-10NL)

SUIT CHECK: Same suit = suited (s). Different = offsuit (o).

BLITZ POOL EXPLOITS (PRINT MONEY HERE)
- Blinds fold 65-75% to BTN/CO steals → steal relentlessly
- 3-bets are 88-92% value → respect and fold marginal hands
- Turn raises are 95% value, river raises are 98% value → fold one pair
- Players underfold to value bets → bet bigger with made hands
- Almost no river bluffs → don't hero call without showdown value
- Multi-way pots go to showdown → tighten up, value bet only

OPEN RAISE (2.5bb) - POSITION IS PROFIT

UTG (12% range - tight is right):
77+, ATs+, KQs, AQo+

MP (16% range - add suited wheel aces):
66+, A9s+, A5s-A2s, KJs+, QJs, JTs, AJo+, KQo

CO (28% range - steal mode activated):
44+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T8s+, 97s+, 86s+, 76s, 65s, ATo+, KJo+, QJo

BTN (48% range - maximum aggression):
22+, A2s+, K6s+, Q7s+, J7s+, T7s+, 96s+, 85s+, 75s+, 64s+, 54s, A7o+, K9o+, QTo+, JTo

SB (22% range - raise or fold, never complete):
55+, A2s+, K8s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T8s+, 98s, 87s, A9o+, KTo+

WHY THESE RANGES? Blinds overfold. Every fold you generate is +EV.

VS SINGLE OPEN - RESPECT STRENGTH

3-bet for value:
vs UTG/MP: QQ+, AKs, AKo
vs CO: JJ+, AQs+, AKo
vs BTN: TT+, AQs+, AKo

3-bet bluff (blockers + foldability):
vs CO (from BTN/SB): A5s-A4s, K9s-K8s (blocks AK/AQ, folds better)
vs BTN (from SB/BB): A5s-A2s, K9s (high fold equity)

Call IP (set mine + playability):
vs UTG/MP: JJ-88, AQs-AJs, KQs
vs CO: TT-66, AJs-ATs, KQs-KJs, QJs, JTs, T9s
vs BTN: 99-44, ATs-A8s, KJs-KTs, QJs-QTs, JTs, T9s, 98s, 87s

SB: 3-bet or fold (flatting = -EV)

BB DEFENSE - DEFEND FREQUENCY MATTERS

vs BTN (defend 55-60%):
3-bet: TT+, AQs+, AKo, A5s-A4s, K9s
Call: 99-22, AJs-A2s, KTs+, Q9s+, J9s+, T8s+, 97s+, 86s+, 76s, 65s, 54s, A9o+, KJo, QJo, JTo
Fold: K8o-, Q9o-, J9o-, T9o, weak offsuit

vs CO (defend 48-52%):
3-bet: QQ+, AKs, AKo
Call: JJ-44, AQs-A7s, KQs-KTs, QJs-QTs, JTs, T9s, 98s, AJo, KJo
Fold: rest

vs MP (defend 42-46%):
3-bet: QQ+, AKs, AKo
Call: JJ-66, AQs-A9s, KQs-KJs, QJs, JTs, AJo
Fold: rest

vs UTG (defend 38-42%):
3-bet: QQ+, AKs, AKo
Call: JJ-77, AQs-ATs, KQs, AJo
Fold: rest

VS 3-BET - THEY HAVE IT

4-bet/call: KK+, AKs
4-bet/fold: AKo (vs UTG/MP 3-bet, fold to 5-bet)
Call IP only: QQ, JJ, AQs
Fold: TT-, AJo, KQo, all suited connectors, all small pairs OOP

WHY FOLD SO MUCH? Blitz 3-bets are real. Calling AJo vs QQ+ is burning money.

VS 4-BET

All-in: KK+
Call: AKs (if <100bb effective)
Fold: QQ, AKo (unless specific read)

POSTFLOP - VALUE BET BIGGER

Made hands (they call light, charge them):
Nuts (straights/flushes/boats): 100% pot all streets
Sets: 85% pot all streets
Two pair: 80% pot all streets
Top pair top kicker (AK on Axx): 75%/70%/60% (flop/turn/river)
Top pair good kicker (AQ on Axx): 70%/65%/50%
Top pair weak kicker (K7 on Kxx): 65% flop, check-call turn/river
Overpair (QQ on J85): 70%/60%/50%
Overpair on ace-high board (KK on Axx): check-call only

Draws (semi-bluff with fold equity):
Combo draws (flush+straight, flush+pair): 70% pot
Flush draw alone: check if free, call ≤40% pot, bet if checked to
Straight draw alone: check if free, call ≤35% pot
Gutshot: check-fold unless combo draw

Weak hands (minimize losses):
Bottom pair: check-fold
Middle pair weak kicker: check-call once, fold to turn bet
Ace-high/king-high: check-fold (don't bluff)

FACING AGGRESSION - BELIEVE THEM

Flop raise: Continue with top pair top kicker+, fold rest
Turn raise: Continue with two pair+, fold one pair
River raise: Continue with straights+, fold everything else

MULTI-WAY POTS (3+ players)

Preflop: Tighten by 20% (fold small pairs, suited connectors)
Postflop: Value bet only, no bluffs
Showdown: Expect to see strong hands

STACK DEPTH ADJUSTMENTS

<50bb (short stack):
- Tighten opens by 15%
- 3-bet shove: 99+, AJs+, AQo+
- Fold small pairs (no implied odds)

50-100bb (standard):
- Use default ranges

>100bb (deep stack):
- Widen calls with suited connectors/small pairs
- Avoid marginal all-ins
- Play more postflop

RAKE CONSIDERATIONS (2NL-5NL)

High rake = tighten up:
- Fold marginal calls (87s, 76s, small pairs OOP)
- Don't bluff (rake makes pots less profitable)
- Value bet bigger (need to overcome rake)

DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENTS

If blinds fold >70% to your steals:
Open 100% from BTN, add K4s+, Q6s+, J7s+, T7s+, 97s+, A5o+, K7o+ from CO

If blinds 3-bet <8%:
Never fold 99+, AQs+, AKo to 3-bet
Call more: 88-77, AJs, KQs

If villain opens >40% from CO/BTN:
3-bet wider: add AQo, KQs, A3s-A2s, K8s
Call wider: add 33-22, A7s-A6s, K9s, Q9s

If villain folds to 3-bet >70%:
3-bet any two from BTN vs CO/SB opens
3-bet K4s+, Q7s+, J8s+, T8s+, 98s from SB vs BTN

AUTO-FOLD (ALWAYS)

Preflop opens from EP/MP:
A6o-A2o, K9o-K2o, Q9o-Q2o, J9o-J2o, T8o-T2o
Suited gappers <65s (75s, 64s, 53s)

Facing 3-bet:
AJo, ATo, KQo, KJo, QJo (dominated)
TT-22 out of position
99-22 vs UTG/MP 3-bet
All suited connectors (98s, 87s, 76s, 65s)

Facing turn raise:
One pair any kicker
Two pair if board has straight/flush

Facing river raise:
Anything below straights
Straights if board paired (they have boat)

MENTAL GAME

Every hand = new opponent (no reads)
Play fundamentals, not exploits
When they show strength, believe them
When you have it, bet big
Variance is high, focus on long-term EV
Track steal success rate (target >65%)

WIN RATE FORMULA

Your profit comes from:
40% - Stealing blinds (open wider from BTN/CO)
35% - Value betting made hands (bet bigger)
15% - Folding to aggression (don't pay off)
10% - Not bluffing rivers (they call)

KEY PRINCIPLES

1. STEAL BLINDS - They fold too much, open wider late position
2. RESPECT 3-BETS - They're not bluffing, fold marginal hands
3. VALUE BET BIGGER - They call light, charge them
4. FOLD TO AGGRESSION - Turn/river raises are real
5. POSITION IS EVERYTHING - Play tight OOP, wide IP
6. DON'T BLUFF RIVERS - They don't fold, save chips
7. DON'T HERO CALL - When in doubt, fold
8. MULTI-WAY = TIGHTEN - More players = stronger hands shown down
