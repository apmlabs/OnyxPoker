BLITZ 6-MAX PREFLOP STRATEGY v2 (2NL-10NL)

SUIT: Same = suited (s). Different = offsuit (o).

BLITZ POOL EXPLOITS
- Blinds fold 65-70% to BTN/CO → steal aggressively
- 3-bets are 88-92% value → respect them, fold marginal
- Turn raises 94% value, river raises 97% value → fold one pair
- Pool calls value light → size up with made hands
- Almost zero river bluffs → never hero call

UTG (13%):
77+, ATs+, KQs, AQo+

MP (17%):
66+, A9s+, A5s-A3s, KJs+, QJs, JTs, AJo+, KQo

- vs UTG: QQ+, AKs, AKo
- vs MP: QQ+, AKs, AKo (add JJ if loose)

- Call: 99-22, AJs-A2s, KTs+, Q9s+, J9s+, T8s+, 97s+, 86s+, 76s, 65s, A9o+, KJo, QJo

Call: AKs (<100bb)
Fold: QQ, AKo, everything else
