BLITZ/ZOOM PREFLOP STRATEGY (2NL-5NL 6-MAX)

Reality of Blitz:
- New opponents every hand - NO reads possible
- Players fold weak hands instantly (why wait with trash?)
- When someone plays back, they usually HAVE IT
- Pots that go to showdown are often monster vs monster
- Pool is tighter than regular tables (weak hands = click fold)

CORE PRINCIPLES

1. TIGHTEN UP - Blitz pools are nittier than regular tables
2. VALUE HEAVY - When you bet, bet for value (bluffs get called by better)
3. RESPECT AGGRESSION - 3-bets and raises are real, not bluffs
4. POSITION IS KING - Play way more hands IP, very tight OOP
5. DON'T HERO CALL - They have it more often than regular tables

OPEN RAISE (2.5bb standard)

UTG
- Raise: 99+, AJs+, KQs, AQo+

MP  
- Raise: 77+, ATs+, KJs+, QJs, AJo+, KQo

CO
- Raise: 55+, A8s+, A5s-A4s, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, T9s, 98s, ATo+, KJo+

BTN
- Raise: 22+, A2s+, K8s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T8s+, 97s+, 86s+, 76s, 65s, A7o+, KTo+, QJo

SB (raise or fold - NEVER complete)
- Raise: 55+, A4s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T8s+, 98s, 87s, A9o+, KJo+

3-BET RANGES (keep it tight - Blitz 3-bets are VALUE)

vs UTG/MP open
- 3-bet: QQ+, AKs, AKo
- Call IP: JJ-99, AQs (fold AQo, KQs - dominated too often)
- Fold rest

vs CO open
- 3-bet: JJ+, AKs, AKo, AQs
- Call IP: TT-77, AJs, KQs
- Fold rest

vs BTN open
- 3-bet: TT+, AQs+, AKo, A5s-A4s (some bluffs ok here)
- Call: 99-55, AJs-ATs, KQs-KJs, QJs, JTs, T9s
- Fold rest

FACING 3-BET (they have it - be disciplined)

- 4-bet/call: KK+, AKs
- Call: QQ, JJ, AKo, AQs (IP only)
- FOLD EVERYTHING ELSE

Why fold so much? Blitz 3-bets are 90% value. AJo, KQo, TT are losing calls.

BLIND DEFENSE

BB vs BTN (defend but don't go crazy)
- 3-bet: JJ+, AQs+, AKo, A5s-A4s
- Call: TT-22, AJs-A7s, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, T9s, 98s, 87s, 76s
- Fold: offsuit junk, weak aces, dominated hands

BB vs CO/MP (tighter - they're stronger)
- 3-bet: QQ+, AKs, AKo
- Call: JJ-77, AQs-ATs, KQs
- Fold rest

SB vs any open (3-bet or fold ONLY)
- 3-bet: TT+, AQs+, AKo
- Fold: everything else (flatting SB = lighting money on fire)

KEY BLITZ ADJUSTMENTS

1. FOLD MORE TO 3-BETS
   - Regular table: "maybe he's bluffing"
   - Blitz: he's not bluffing, fold your AJo

2. DON'T BLUFF 3-BET
   - Light 3-bets work on regs you have reads on
   - In Blitz, random villain calls with QQ and you're dead

3. VALUE BET THINNER POSTFLOP
   - When you have it, bet - they'll call with worse
   - When you don't have it, give up - they're not folding

4. RESPECT TURN/RIVER RAISES
   - In Blitz, turn raise = nuts or close to it
   - Don't pay off with one pair

5. SMALL PAIRS ARE MARGINAL
   - 22-55 need to hit sets to win
   - Fold them OOP, only play IP vs single raise

6. SUITED CONNECTORS NEED POSITION
   - 76s, 87s, 98s are great on BTN
   - Trash from blinds - fold them

HANDS TO AUTO-FOLD IN BLITZ

Preflop (always):
- Any offsuit hand worse than A7o
- K9o, Q9o, J9o, T9o from early position
- Small suited gappers (75s, 64s, 53s) from blinds
- A9o-A2o facing any raise

Facing 3-bet (always):
- AJo, ATo, KQo, KJo
- TT, 99 out of position
- Any suited connector
- Any small pair

THE BLITZ MINDSET

You're playing against the POOL, not individuals.
- Pool is tight → your steals work more often
- Pool is value-heavy → don't bluff catch
- Pool folds trash → when they play, respect it
- You can't adjust to players → play solid fundamentals

Win rate comes from:
1. Stealing blinds with position
2. Value betting made hands
3. Folding marginal hands to aggression
4. NOT paying off monsters with one pair
