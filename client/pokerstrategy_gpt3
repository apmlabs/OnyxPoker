====================================
POSTFLOP — SIMPLE, ROBUST FRAMEWORK
====================================

GENERAL PRIORITIES (NL5 Zoom)
- Win by: value betting correctly + avoiding big mistakes in 3-bet pots + overfolding rivers vs raises
- Default: under-bluff rivers; use bluffs mainly on flop/turn with equity or strong blockers

SINGLE-RAISED POTS (SRP) — C-BET RULES
- Dry high-card boards where you have range advantage (Axx/Kxx/Qxx, paired boards): c-bet small 25–35% often
- Low, connected, two-tone boards (987/876/765): check more; bet when you have strong equity (TP+good kicker, big draws)
- Multiway: reduce c-bets sharply; bet mostly for value + strong draws

VALUE SIZING (SRP baseline)
- Versus "calls too much" profiles: use bigger sizes on flop/turn (50–80%) with strong value
- TPTK: usually 2 streets for value; 3 streets mainly vs stations and on safe runouts
- Weak top pair: bet once, then check/call small; fold to big turn/river pressure

DRAWS
- Bet/semi-bluff when you have: nut FD, strong OESD, combo draw, or good overcards + FD
- Avoid pure low-equity barrels (gutshot no overcards) unless villain overfolds (HUD trigger)

3-BET POTS (MOST IMPORTANT NODE AT NL5)
- As 3-bettor IP on dry boards: small c-bet 25–33% very often
- As caller OOP: check a lot; continue with strong pairs, good draws, and strong backdoors
- One-pair in 3-bet pot: do not stack off without a clear reason (runout + villain profile)

FACING AGGRESSION (DEFAULT POPULATION)
- Flop raises are value-heavy: continue mainly with strong top pair+, big draws
- Turn raises: fold most one-pair
- River raises: fold almost all one-pair; call with very strong hands only
