BLITZ 6-MAX EXPLOITATIVE STRATEGY (2NL-10NL)

SUIT CHECK: Same suit = suited (s). Different = offsuit (o).

BLITZ POOL FACTS (EXPLOIT THESE)
- Blinds fold 65-75% to BTN/CO steals → steal wide
- 3-bets are 90%+ value → fold marginal hands
- Turn raises 95% value, river raises 98% value → fold one pair
- Players underfold to value → bet bigger
- No river bluffs → don't hero call

WIN RATE SOURCES

40% - Stealing blinds (open wide from BTN/CO)
35% - Value betting big (they call light)
15% - Folding to aggression (they have it)
10% - Not bluffing rivers (they call)

KEY PRINCIPLES

1. STEAL RELENTLESSLY - Blinds overfold, print money from position
2. RESPECT 3-BETS - They're value, fold marginal hands
3. VALUE BET BIGGER - They call light, charge them
4. FOLD TO AGGRESSION - Turn/river raises are real
5. POSITION IS PROFIT - Tight OOP, wide IP
6. DON'T BLUFF RIVERS - They don't fold
7. DON'T HERO CALL - When in doubt, fold
