=== POSTFLOP (Optimized from session analysis) ===

CORE PRINCIPLE: Fish check 73% of time. When checked to, BET FOR VALUE.
When they bet, THEY HAVE IT - fold without strong hand.

VALUE BETTING (checked to us):
- Straights+: Bet 100% pot all streets
- Sets: Bet 85% pot all streets  
- Two pair: Bet 75% pot (not 80% - smaller vs passive)
- TPTK: Bet 65%/55%/45% (flop/turn/river)
- TPGK: Bet 55%/45%/check (don't thin value river)
- TPWK: Bet 45% flop only, then check
- Overpair: Bet 60%/50%/40%
- Overpair on Axx: CHECK-CALL only (they have ace)

DRAWS (semi-bluff when checked to):
- Combo draw: Bet 60% pot
- Flush draw: Bet 50% pot flop/turn
- OESD: Bet 45% pot flop only
- Gutshot: Check (no fold equity vs fish)

WEAK HANDS:
- Middle pair: Check, call small bets flop only
- Bottom pair: Check-fold
- High card: Check-fold (NEVER bluff)

=== FACING BETS (Session 33 fixes) ===

CRITICAL: When passive fish bet, BELIEVE THEM.

PAIRED BOARD + HIGH CARD = FOLD (KQ on AA99, AK on 2265)
DOUBLE PAIRED BOARD = Need full house+ to continue
POT-SIZED RIVER BET = Need two pair+ to call

Call with:
- Sets+: Always call/raise
- Two pair: Call (fold weak two pair vs big river bet)
- TPTK: Call flop/turn, fold to big river bets
- TPWK: Call flop only
- Overpair: Call down, fold to pot-sized river
- Flush draw: Call ≤30% pot
- OESD: Call ≤25% pot

Fold:
- High card (no showdown value)
- Bottom pair
- Middle pair on turn/river
- Any hand on paired board without trips+

=== KEY DIFFERENCES FROM BASE SONNET ===

1. SMALLER BET SIZES: 75% → 65% for two pair, etc. (fish call anyway)
2. NO RIVER VALUE WITH TPGK: They only call river with better
3. STRICTER FACING BETS: Fold high card on paired boards always
4. NO BLUFFING: Fish don't fold, save your chips
5. CHECK MORE WITH WEAK: Don't "thin value" middle pair

=== WIN RATE FORMULA ===

vs 70% fish tables:
- 50% profit from value betting made hands
- 30% profit from stealing blinds
- 20% profit from folding to aggression (not paying off)
- 0% from bluffing (they call)

Expected: +30-35 BB/100 on easy tables
