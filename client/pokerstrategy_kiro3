BLITZ 6-MAX EXPLOITATIVE STRATEGY (2NL-10NL)

SUIT CHECK: Same suit = suited (s). Different = offsuit (o).

BLITZ POOL TENDENCIES (EXPLOIT THESE)
- Blinds overfold to steals (60-70% fold vs BTN/CO)
- 3-bets are 90% value (respect them)
- Turn/river raises = nuts (fold one pair)
- Players underfold to value bets (bet bigger)
- No one bluffs rivers (don't hero call)

OPEN RAISE (2.5bb) - STEAL RELENTLESSLY

UTG: 88+, ATs+, KQs, AQo+
MP: 66+, A9s+, A5s-A2s, KJs+, QJs, JTs, AJo+, KQo
CO: 44+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T8s+, 97s+, 86s+, 76s, 65s, ATo+, KJo+, QJo
BTN: 22+, A2s+, K5s+, Q7s+, J7s+, T7s+, 96s+, 85s+, 75s+, 64s+, 54s, A7o+, K9o+, QTo+, JTo
SB: 55+, A2s+, K8s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T9s, 98s, 87s, A9o+, KTo+ (raise or fold)

WHY WIDER? Blinds fold too much. Print money by stealing.

VS SINGLE OPEN - RESPECT IT

3-bet value:
- vs UTG/MP: QQ+, AKs, AKo
- vs CO: JJ+, AQs+, AKo
- vs BTN: TT+, AQs+, AKo, A5s-A4s (bluff)

Call IP (set mine + playability):
- vs UTG/MP: JJ-88, AQs-AJs, KQs
- vs CO: TT-66, AJs-ATs, KQs-KJs, QJs, JTs, T9s
- vs BTN: 99-44, ATs-A8s, KJs-KTs, QJs-QTs, JTs, T9s, 98s, 87s

SB: 3-bet or fold. Flatting SB = burning money.

BB DEFENSE - DEFEND WIDER (they steal too much)

vs BTN (defend 60%):
- 3-bet: TT+, AQs+, AKo, A5s-A4s, K9s (bluff)
- Call: 99-22, AJs-A2s, KTs+, Q9s+, J9s+, T8s+, 97s+, 86s+, 76s, 65s, A9o+, KJo, QJo, JTo
- Fold: trash offsuit (K8o-, Q9o-, J9o-, T9o)

vs CO (defend 50%):
- 3-bet: QQ+, AKs, AKo
- Call: JJ-44, AQs-A7s, KQs-KTs, QJs-QTs, JTs, T9s, 98s, AJo, KJo
- Fold: rest

vs MP/UTG (defend 40%):
- 3-bet: QQ+, AKs, AKo
- Call: JJ-66, AQs-A9s, KQs-KJs, QJs, JTs, AJo
- Fold: rest

VS 3-BET - THEY HAVE IT

4-bet/call: KK+, AKs
Call IP: QQ, JJ, AKo, AQs (IP only)
Fold: TT-, AJo, KQo, all suited connectors, all small pairs

WHY FOLD SO MUCH? Blitz 3-bets are real. AJo vs QQ+ is lighting money on fire.

POSTFLOP - VALUE BET BIGGER

Made hands (they call too light):
- Nuts (straights/flushes/boats): 100% pot all streets
- Sets: 85% pot all streets
- Two pair: 80% pot all streets
- Top pair top kicker (AK on Axx): 75% flop, 70% turn, 60% river
- Top pair good kicker (AQ on Axx): 70% flop, 65% turn, 50% river
- Top pair weak kicker (K7 on Kxx): 65% flop, check-call turn/river
- Overpair (QQ on J85): 70% flop, 60% turn, 50% river
- Overpair on scary board (KK on Axx): check-call only

Draws (semi-bluff when fold equity):
- Combo draws (flush+straight, flush+pair): 70% pot
- Flush draw alone: check if free, call up to 40% pot, bet if checked to
- Straight draw alone: check if free, call up to 35% pot

Weak hands (give up):
- Bottom pair: check-fold
- Middle pair weak kicker: check-call once, fold to turn bet
- Ace-high/king-high: check-fold (don't bluff)

FACING AGGRESSION - FOLD MORE

Flop raise: Continue with top pair top kicker+, fold rest
Turn raise: Continue with two pair+, fold one pair (they have it)
River raise: Continue with straights+, fold everything else (they never bluff)

KEY PRINCIPLES

1. STEAL BLINDS - They fold too much, open wider from late position
2. RESPECT 3-BETS - They're not bluffing, fold marginal hands
3. VALUE BET BIGGER - They call light, charge them
4. FOLD TO AGGRESSION - Turn/river raises are real
5. POSITION IS EVERYTHING - Play tight OOP, wide IP
6. DON'T BLUFF RIVERS - They don't fold, save your chips
7. DON'T HERO CALL - When in doubt, fold

WIN RATE FORMULA

Your profit comes from:
1. Stealing blinds (40% of profit) - open wider from BTN/CO
2. Value betting made hands (35% of profit) - bet bigger
3. Folding to aggression (15% of profit) - don't pay off
4. Not bluffing rivers (10% of profit) - they call

MENTAL GAME

- Every hand is vs new opponent (no reads)
- Play fundamentals, not exploits vs individuals
- When they show strength, believe them
- When you have it, bet big (they call)
- Variance is high, focus on long-term EV
- Track your steal success rate (should be >60%)
