# OPTIMAL_STATS Strategy - GTO-inspired for 6-max cash games
# Designed to hit industry-standard winning player stats:
# VPIP: 21%, PFR: 18%, Gap: 3%, 3-bet: 8%, 4-bet: 25%, Fold to 3bet: 60%
# AF: 2.5, C-bet: 65-75%

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES
# 1. Raise or fold preflop - minimize calling (low gap)
# 2. 3-bet wider for value AND bluffs (8% target)
# 3. 4-bet wider - don't fold premiums to 3-bets (25% target)
# 4. C-bet most flops (65-75%) but give up on turn without equity
# 5. Balanced postflop AF (2.5) - not too passive, not too aggro

## PREFLOP - TIGHT BUT AGGRESSIVE

QQ, JJ, TT, AKo, AQs

### 4-Bet (wider - 25% of opens that face 3-bet)
KK+, AKs, AKo, AQs, JJ (vs late position 3-bet)

### Fold to 3-Bet (~60% target)
Fold: All hands not in call_3bet or 4bet ranges
Key: Don't defend too wide - 3-bets are usually strong

## POSTFLOP - BALANCED AGGRESSION (AF 2.5)

### C-Betting (65-75% on flop)
# C-bet when:
- We have any pair or better
- We have any draw (flush draw, OESD, gutshot)
- Board favors our range (high cards, dry texture)
- Heads-up in position

# Check when:
- Multiway pots with air
- Wet boards that hit caller's range
- We called preflop (not aggressor)

### Bet Sizing
Flop: 50-66% pot (smaller on dry, larger on wet)
Turn: 66-75% pot
River: 75-100% pot for value, 50-66% for bluffs

### Made Hands
Monsters (sets+): Bet 75% pot all streets, raise if bet into
Two pair: Bet 70% pot, call raises
Top pair good kicker: Bet 60% flop, 50% turn, check-call river
Top pair weak kicker: Bet 50% flop, check turn/river
Overpair: Bet 65% all streets, fold to big raises on scary boards
Middle pair: Check-call flop, fold to turn aggression
Bottom pair: Check-fold (unless heads-up with position)

### Draws
Flush draw: Bet 50% pot as semi-bluff, call up to 40% pot
OESD: Bet 50% pot, call up to 35% pot
Gutshot: Check-call 25% pot, fold to larger
Combo draw: Bet 66% pot, can call all-in

### Facing Aggression
- Sets+: Raise for value
- Two pair: Call, raise only on safe boards
- Top pair: Call one street, fold to continued aggression
- Overpair: Call flop/turn, fold river to big bets on scary boards
- Draws: Call if pot odds justify, fold otherwise
- Air: Fold (don't hero call)

### Key Differences from Other Strategies
1. Lower VPIP (21% vs 32% value_*) - tighter hand selection
2. Higher 3-bet% (8% vs 3-6%) - more re-raising
3. Higher 4-bet% (25% vs 8%) - defend opens better
4. Lower fold to 3-bet (60% vs 80%) - don't overfold
5. Balanced AF (2.5 vs 5.0 value_*) - not overaggressive
6. Higher c-bet (70% vs 37% sonnet) - take more pots
