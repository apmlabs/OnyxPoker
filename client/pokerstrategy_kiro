BLITZ REALITY

1. No reads - new table every hand
2. 3-bets are value (90%+ real hands)
3. Turn/river raises = nuts
4. Showdowns = monster vs monster
5. Pool is tighter than regular tables

POSTFLOP PRINCIPLES

Made hands (bet for value):
- Straights/flushes/sets/full house: 75-100% pot all streets
- Two pair: 75% pot all streets
- Top pair good kicker (AK/AQ on Axx): 70% flop, 65% turn, 50% river
- Top pair weak kicker (K7 on Kxx): 70% flop, check-call turn/river
- Overpair on scary board (KK on Axx): check-call, never raise

Draws:
- Combo draws (flush+straight, flush+pair): semi-bluff 65-75% pot
- Flush draw alone: check if free, call up to 40% pot
- Straight draw alone: check if free, call up to 33% pot

Weak hands:
- Bottom pair: check always, never bet
- No pair no draw: check always, never bet
- Ace-high/king-high: check, don't bluff

Facing aggression:
- Respect turn/river raises (they have it)
- Don't hero call with one pair
- When in doubt, fold (Blitz players don't bluff much)

FOLD ALWAYS

Preflop:
- Offsuit trash: A6o-A2o, K9o-K2o, Q9o-Q2o, J9o-J2o, T8o-T2o
- Weak suited: K7s-K2s (except BTN), Q8s-Q2s (except BTN), J8s-J2s (except BTN)
- Gappers: 75s, 64s, 53s, 42s (except BTN)

Facing 3-bet:
- AJo, ATo, KQo, KJo, QJo
- TT, 99 (unless IP vs BTN)
- All suited connectors
- All small pairs 88-22

KEY ADJUSTMENTS

1. Tighter than regular tables - Blitz pools fold trash instantly
2. Respect aggression - raises are real, not bluffs
3. Value bet bigger - they call light with worse
4. Don't bluff catch - they're not bluffing
5. Position is everything - play tight OOP, wider IP
6. Small pairs need position - fold them OOP
7. Suited connectors need position - fold them from blinds
8. When they play back, they have it - don't pay off

WIN RATE SOURCES

1. Stealing blinds with position (BTN/CO opens)
2. Value betting made hands (bet bigger)
3. Folding marginal hands to aggression (don't hero call)
4. Not paying off monsters (respect turn/river raises)
5. Playing tight OOP (SB 3-bet or fold)
